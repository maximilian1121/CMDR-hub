# Terms of Service & Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026

Welcome to **Commander Hub**. I built this platform for the community to host and share code. By logging in via Discord and using this site, you are agreeing to these terms. If you don’t agree with how I run things, please do not use the service.

---

## ⚖️ TERMS OF SERVICE

### 1. The Service

I provide this platform as a free tool to host and share [CMDR](https://eryn.io/Cmdr/) commands and small files (up to 2MB total per project). I provide this service **"as-is."** While I do my best to keep the lights on, I don’t guarantee 100% uptime, and I am not responsible if your data is lost or deleted.

### 2. Your Content & Roblox Safety

You own the code you upload. By putting it on my site, you grant **me** a license to host, store, and display it based on your chosen privacy settings (Public, Unlisted, or Private).

- **No Malware:** I have a zero-tolerance policy for "beaming" scripts, cookie loggers, or anything that violates the [Roblox Community Standards](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313410).
- **No Sensitive Data:** Do not upload API keys, passwords, or `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookies. I am not responsible for your account safety if you leak your own credentials.
- **Usage Risk:** I do not execute or verify the functionality of the code. If you run a script you found here, you do so **at your own risk**.

### 3. My Review Process

To keep the site from becoming a hub for malicious scripts, I use a manual moderation system:

- **Approval Queue:** If you are a new user, your "Public" projects will stay hidden until **I (or an admin I trust)** manually approve them.
- **Verified Status:** I may grant "Verified" status to trusted users so they can bypass the queue, but I still reserve the right to moderate their content.
- **Right to Refuse:** I reserve the right to reject, hide, or delete any project for any reason—especially if it uses heavy obfuscation to hide malicious intent.

### 4. What I Won’t Allow With 0 Lenience

By using my site, you promise not to:

- Attempt to bypass my file size limits (512KB per file / 2MB per project).
- Use my platform to promote "Free Robux" scams or harass other users.
- Attempt to scrape my data or disrupt my server infrastructure.
- Attempt to destroy my infrastructure, Vercel free plan would not like that...

### 5. Account Termination

I reserve the right to ban any account that violates these terms. If I ban you, you lose access to the platform and I may delete all projects associated with your account.

## 🔒 PRIVACY POLICY

### 1. Data Collection & Authentication

I use **Supabase** to manage authentication securely. Depending on how you choose to sign up, I collect the following information:

- **Discord OAuth:** If you sign in via Discord, I collect your **Discord User ID**, **Username**, **Avatar**, and **Email address**.
- **Email & Password:** If you register directly, I collect your **Email address**. - _Note: I never see, ask for, or store your "raw" password. Supabase handles the encryption (hashing) so your credentials remain private even from me._

### 2. How I Store Data & Third Parties

Your data is stored and processed using industry-standard services:

- **Project Data:** Your code, files, likes, and comments are stored in my database and storage buckets.
- **Supabase:** This is my primary backend. They handle the database, file storage, and secure authentication.
- **DiceBear:** If you don't have a Discord avatar or haven't uploaded a profile picture, I use DiceBear to generate a unique placeholder image for your profile. This cannot be changed as I really don't want explicit content on my site!

### 3. Data Visibility & Privacy

You have full control over who can see your projects:

- **Public:** Everyone can see the project once it has been approved.
- **Unlisted:** The project is hidden from lists, but anyone with the direct URL can view it.
- **Private:** Only you and the site admin can see it. - _Admin Note: I only view private projects if they are flagged for moderation purposes (e.g., reports of malicious code or TOS violations)._

### 4. Managing & Deleting Your Data

- **Project Deletion:** You can delete your projects at any time through your dashboard.
- **Account Deletion:** If you would like to permanently wipe your account and all associated data (including email records and Discord IDs) from the database, please contact me at the email address listed below.
